# L2BuffChecker
Lineage II Buff Checker with sound effect. Based on OCR techniques.

## Usage
Press the scan button and a small window will popup. This window must be placed on top of your buffs. Basically, the window
is used to fasten the searching of the first buff pixel.

After the coordinates have been detected, just mark the buffs that you want to be tracked and start the program.
A sound will play every time the different buffs are not detected on your buff bar.

It does not have any impact in computer performance while running.
